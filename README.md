# Insertion Sort

A simple single class implementation of insertion sort in Java. The user will be prompted to input the number of elements in a list array which they want to enter. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Insertion sorting algorithm concept is based on arranging the cards in your one hand. like suppose when you pick up first card that is already sorted you no need to do with that one. There are two iterations come in picture first one picks cards and another one is shifts card from right to left in ascending order and out of inner loop last element inserted So first outer loop runs left to right but begin from the second element of list. Outer pointer element need to store in temporary variable because it overrides inner loop while shifting.

## How to use it.
* Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (InsertionSort.java).
* Type 'javac InsertionSort.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line.
* Now, type 'java InsertionSort' to run your program.
* You will be able to see a output line and asking input to enter number of elements (integer) you want to enter.
* Next you will enter number of element it can be space separated or in new line.
* After completion of entering elements in list, program will show sorted list.
