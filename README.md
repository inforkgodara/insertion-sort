# Insertion Sort

A simple single class implementation of insertion sort in Java. The user will be prompted to input the number of elements in a list array which they want to enter. The user then will choose a element to be sorted in the list. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## How to use it.
* Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (InsertionSort.java).
* Type 'javac InsertionSort.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line.
* Now, type 'java InsertionSort' to run your program.
* You will be able to see a output line and asking input to enter number of elements (integer) you want to enter.
* Next you will enter number of element it can be space separated or in new line.
* After completion of entering elements in list, program will show sorted list.
